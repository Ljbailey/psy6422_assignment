The six_dimensions.csv file contains data on countries cultural dimensions according to Hofstede's 
cultural dimension theory. This dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/tarukofusuki/hofstedes-6d-model-of-national-culture.
The data is from 2015 and requires some formating. The codes represent the following:
ctr = country code
country = country
pdi = power distance index
idv = individualism - collectivism
mas = masculinity - femininity 
uai = uncertainty avoidance
ltowvs = long-term orientation vs short-term orientation
ivr = indulgence vs restraint
Only the individualism - collectivism continuum was used in this project. 
Higher scores represent individualist cultural values whereas lower scores represents collectivist cultural
values.Individuals in individualist cultures primarily care for themselves and immediate family members and 
have a self-image of “I” whereas individuals in collectivist cultures care for their society as a whole 
and have a self-image of “we”. For more information on the data you can visit https://www.hofstede-insights.com/
